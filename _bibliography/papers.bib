    title={Variational adiabatic transport of tensor networks}, 
    author={Hyeongjin Kim and Matthew T. Fishman and Dries Sels},
    abstract={We discuss a tensor network method for constructing the adiabatic gauge potential -- the generator of adiabatic transformations -- as a matrix product operator, which allows us to adiabatically transport matrix product states. Adiabatic evolution of tensor networks offers a wide range of applications, of which two are explored in this paper: improving tensor network optimization and scanning phase diagrams. By efficiently transporting eigenstates to quantum criticality and performing intermediary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) optimizations along the way, we demonstrate that we can compute ground and low-lying excited states faster and more reliably than a standard DMRG method at or near quantum criticality. We demonstrate a simple automated step size adjustment and detection of the critical point based on the norm of the adiabatic gauge potential. Remarkably, we are able to reliably transport states through the critical point of the models we study.},

@article{kim2023integrability,
  title={Integrability is attractive},
  author={Kim, Hyeongjin and Polkovnikov, Anatoli},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.09745},
  abstract={The interplay between quantum chaos and integrability has been extensively studied in the past decades. We approach this topic from the point of view of geometry encoded in the quantum geometric tensor, which describes the complexity of adiabatic transformations. In particular, we consider two generic models of spin chains that are parameterized by two independent couplings. In one, the integrability breaking perturbation is global while, in the other, integrability is broken only at the boundary. In both cases, the shortest paths in the coupling space lead towards integrable regions and we argue that this behavior is generic. These regions thus act as attractors of adiabatic flows similar to river basins in nature. Physically, the directions towards integrable regions are characterized by faster relaxation dynamics than those parallel to integrability. The anisotropy between them diverges in the thermodynamic limit as the system approaches the integrable point. As side results, we provide evidence that the transition from integrable to chaotic behavior is universal for both models, similar to continuous phase transitions, and that the model with local integrability breaking quickly becomes chaotic but avoids ergodicity even in the thermodynamic limit.},
