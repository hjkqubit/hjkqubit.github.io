I am a fourth year physics Ph.D student at Boston University, advised by Professor [Anatoli Polkovnikov](http://physics.bu.edu/~asp28/){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests are in classical and quantum chaos in many-body systems, and tensor network algorithms. My work mainly involves numerics such as exact diagonalization, solving coupled ODEs, and tensor networks.

I received my B.A. in physics at Williams College, advised by Professor [Frederick Strauch](https://physics.williams.edu/profile/fws1/){:target="\_blank"}.

For a more detailed summary, please check out my [cv](https://hjkqubit.github.io/assets/pdf/cv2025.pdf){:target="\_blank"}!
