I am a third year physics Ph.D student at Boston University, advised by [Anatoli Polkovnikov](http://physics.bu.edu/~asp28/){:target="\_blank"}. My research interests are in quantum integrability and chaos in many-body systems, and tensor network algorithms.

I received my B.A. in physics at Williams College.
